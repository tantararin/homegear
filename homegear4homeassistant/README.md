# Homegear4Homeassistant

Well done ...

This plugin heavily uses the original Docker Image from the Homegear project.\
I only extended and modified the scripts for working as a HASS plugin. 


Primarly I build it for my own, because I don't want to replace my MAX! and 4uControl (MAX! in Spain) Devices and don't want to power two raspberry PI at home


Feel free to use my AddOn, but keep in mind it comes absolutely without warranty and support \
(of course feel free to give feedback on githab, I will do my best to fix problems).

# Usage
1) Add this repo to your HASS Repomanager 
2) Install the Plugin and start it (There are no HASSIO Addon Configuration parameters yet)
3) At first boot, the Addon creates a homegear directory in your config folder. You have to configure it like a stand alone homegear system. 
4) Restart the AddOn 
6) For communicaton with hass, add a CCU config to your /config/configuration.yaml (Includeing the Port 2001 for RPC Communication)


# WebGui
The Admin GUI is available via http://your-hass:2001/admin

# Restricions
You can't use the CLI Configuration. You can add devices via ADMIN-UI (tested with MAX! and 4uControl)

# Examples

#### configuration.yaml
``` yaml
#Homematic (Homegear)
homematic:
  interfaces:
    wireless:
      host: 10.4.4.113
      resolvenames: metadata
      port: 2001
```
